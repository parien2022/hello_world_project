# Development Environment

For this project I'm using npm init to initialize node.js project, then I installed necessary dev dependencies such as TypeScript language, ts-node(for compiling the code into js and running it with node), @types/node, @types/express (some useful tools for future use) and nodemon. I also created a tsconfig.json file with npx tsc --init.

I use TypeScript for the project, it is a language that builds on JavaScript, it enhances JS using static types that let you find potential errors before runtime and handle better error caching, it compiles into plain JS before running.
